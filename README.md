Deep Learning Analysis of Plane Crashes
This project employs advanced deep learning techniques to analyze and predict aircraft incidents using extensive historical datasets. The methodology encompasses thorough data preprocessing, model construction with TensorFlow and Keras, and rigorous training and hyperparameter tuning to optimize prediction accuracy. The project aims to identify critical factors in plane crashes, develop predictive models for accident prevention, and implement a real-time monitoring system. The findings indicate that deep learning models, particularly the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) architecture, significantly enhance the accuracy and reliability of aviation safety predictions. This research provides a robust foundation for improving real-time incident detection and analysis, contributing to enhanced aviation safety protocols and proactive risk mitigation strategies.
